## Visualization of algorithms for minimizing maximum lateness

Yet another small JavaScript project created for my studies (Real-time Computing Systems course) in 2008.

The task was to implement different algorithms for minimizing maximum lateness for below problems:
* **1|rj=0|Lmax** (a simple single machine case)
* **1|rj,prm|Lmax** (preemptive tasks on single machine)
* **1|rj,prm,prec|Lmax** (preemptive tasks with precedence constraints on single machine)
* **P|pj=1,in-tree|Lmax** (Tree-structured tasks on parallel machines)
